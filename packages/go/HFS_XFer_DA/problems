If a file is overwritten during a copy, I have no way of detecting it and
updating windows correctly.

  maybe check each window and see if a control with a given name exists and
  replace it if it does?

my munger plan won't be sufficient.  I probably need to write a new
function to go through all the windows, not just the ones with the
changed directory in them.
