Bugs:

When an operation fails the windows get updated as if it succeeds.

The scrollbar at the top had some updating problems that fixed
themselves.  Look for handle moving problems.
	
The scrollbars in windows sometimes get messed up.  Pin this down.

Directory sizes are not computed.

moving and deleting files needs to update the hotband

controls get drawn twice when a window is resized.

/* DrawGrowIcon draws the line 15 pixels from the bottom unless the window
goes off the left edge in which case it's 14. */
When a window is off the left edge of the screen the grow box messes up.

Cliff's comments
read about owned resources (wrt DAs, etc.)
Make a todo list for Cliff and bother him about it.

TODO now:						/* stuff that really should be done before go ships */
make the save file invisible
4 bit icons on 8 bit monitors are the wrong color

TODO:								/* stuff that must be done before go is usable */

 7  run DAs from hot band
11  make formatting more robust

Todo:								/* stuff that must be done before go ships */

change asserts to alerts or something
return to go after program completion

the wrong cursor is displayed in the hotband when something is drug from the hotband
cosmetic changes to most controls
make the save file invisible
drag outlines instead of boxes
use correct disk icons (floppy vs. hard)

learn more about BNDLs
make sure I'm closing enough working directories
Check error return conditions on EVERYTHING
look into repeated keys

todo:								/* stuff that should be done before go ships */

add get info
add find file
cast all pointer assignments to 0
look into save and undo
check all comments.  todos in particular.

questions:

am I doing constants from resources correctly
am I getting the color table correctly

comments:

Filenames in the hot band can't have newlines in them.

---------------
format of save file:

complete pathnames of items to be in hotband -- 1/line
<blank line>
complete pathnames of open directories 1 line  \  grouped
rectangle of open directory -- 1 line          /  together
