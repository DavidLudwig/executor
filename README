Executor has not been actively worked on for many years.

Right now I'm putting it on github (with the original authors' permission)
as-is.  I haven't even tried building it in the last year or so.

Included are a bunch of auxiliarly files and miscellaneous front-ends.
It's unlikely anything other than the Linux and win32 ports can be
made to go.

The DOS port required various other libraries that we had permission
to use, but that we did not necessarily have the permission to publish
the source for, so the source to some of the packages that the DOS
port requires is not present in the github repository.

My email address is still <ctm@ardi.com>, although ARDI itself is
defunct.  I get a ridiculous amount of spam and will quite possibly
not see email addressed to me.

For a few years I've been meaning to verify that the code builds,
write a little documentation, explain a little history, maybe even
set up a mailing list for people, etc... but other things have always
taken precedence.
