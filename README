Executor has not been actively worked on for many years.

Included are a bunch of auxiliarly files and miscellaneous front-ends.
It's unlikely anything other than the Linux and win32 ports can be
made to go.

The DOS port required various other libraries that we had permission
to use, but that we did not necessarily have the permission to publish
the source for, so the source to some of the packages that the DOS
port requires is not present in the github repository.

Don't be mislead by configure.ac, Executor currently builds using an
ancient configuration script.  If you want to try to build a version
of Executor for Linux, try doing this (*After you've done a make
install of syn68k):

  mkdir -p build/debug-linux
  cd build/debug-linux
  ../../util/configure.sh  '--target=i486-linux' '--host=i486-linux' '--front-end=x' '--target-gcc=gcc' '--cflags=-fno-strict-aliasing -I/usr/X11R6/include -DNDEBUG -O0 -finline-functions -g -Wall -DRELEASE_INTERNAL -DERROR_SUPPORTED_MASK="(~0)"' '--root=../..' '--target-file-format=glibc' '--sound=linux' '--syn68k-target=i486-linux-glibc'
  make

That should leave you with a binary called executor.  Unfortunately, without
a System Folder, Executor won't even come close to running.

I'll fiddle around a bit and figure out the easiest way to build a
System Folder for Executor from the git repository and add that info next.

My email address is still <ctm@ardi.com>, although ARDI itself is
defunct.  I get a ridiculous amount of spam and will quite possibly
not see email addressed to me.
