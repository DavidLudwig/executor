UNSUPPORTED -- READ ARDI'S WEB SITE

Executor is currently unsupported.  It can be freely used through the
end of 2006.  More information is available at <http://www.ardi.com/>.


RUNNING PROGRAMS DIRECTLY OFF FLOPPIES IS SLOW

Running programs directly off floppies is incredibly slow.  You'll
find it much quicker to use the browser to copy a program from a floppy
onto your hard disk and then run the program directly from there.


PRINTING

Executor/Win32 can print to non-PostScript printers by using
Ghostscript.  If you plan to print from Executor, you'll want to
install Aladdin Ghostscript.  You can also get Aladdin Ghostscript
directly from Aladdin <http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/AFPL/index.htm>.
