It looks like the "Illustrator Formats - Standard/PICT Export" plug-in requires
these routines from "StdCLib":

	fwrite
	free
	memset
	fclose
	fseek
	malloc
	memmove
	strcpy
	strlen
	vsprintf
	fopen

This is a bit evil because it's not at all clear where they should
come from.  A simplistic find/xargs/grep-l search suggests that this
library isn't supplied anywhere in the Illustrator 8 tryout directory.
It may even be a bug that someone didn't realize that they were
requiring this library.

I'll need to write a tool that is better than find/xargs that will
really tell us which libraries are exported by which files.

Foo.

The biggest problem here may be that vsprintf requires a variable
number of arguments.  Other than that it would be trivial to glue our
own StdCLib for at least these functions.

I can probably remove that particular plug-in and get Illustrator 8 to
run further.


UPDATE: Searching for StdCLib on the web shows that StdCLib is present
on all PowerMacs, so we will indeed have to support it.  Not that big
of a deal, per-se, but it's one more thing to do.

If I get rid of "Illustrator Formats - Standard/PICT Export" then we
wind up with a segmentation fault.  If I get rid of all the plug-ins,
then we die as we make a call to a custom CDEF.  I need to look at how
FAT traps are done, althought this doesn't look like what's going on.
Grr... would be nice to be able to disassemble 68k code under PPC
linux gdb.
