<A name="whatversion"><h2>
Question 2.1.  What version of the Macintosh operating system does
Executor emulate?
</h2></A>

Executor knows how to emulate most of System 7.0, but the default
version that Executor reports to applications is System 6.0.7, because
some bad programs make calls to undocumented System 7.0 traps if we
acknowledge that we've implemented System 7.0.  Each time a different
application is run under Executor, Executor checks an application
specific configuration file for application specific settings.  Many
of the configuration files adjust the System to 7.0. 

<p>
You can manually adjust the system version.  Start Executor and call
up the Preferences Panel with Cmd-shift-5 [see
<A href="section3.html#wherecmd">Q3.1 `Where are the Cmd (Clover) and Option keys?'</A>].  Set the System to 7 and click OK (don't save yet; these are just the
Browser settings).  Now start your application, call up the
Preferences Panel again, and save it with the System 7 setting.  After
that, Executor will automatically invoke System 7 support when you run
that application.  
<A name="limitations"><h2>
Question 2.2.  What limitations does Executor 2
have?
</h2></A>

Because the OS and Toolbox have been rewritten from scratch, Executor
2 has limitations, including no serial port access, no modem use, no
AppleTalk, primitive sound, limited System 7 support, no INITs, no
CDEVs and no Internationalization.  
<p>
Executor can read and write 1.44 MB Mac formatted floppy disks, but
due to limitations in PC hardware, <em>can't</em> read or write 800 KB floppy disks.  
<p>
In the lab we have limited serial port access and we're working on
improving sound.  
<A name="q_2_3"><h2>
Question 2.3.  If I have 800 KB floppies, what can I
do?
</h2></A>

Very little.  It is not ARDI's fault and there's nothing we can do
about it, but the way that Apple squeezed 800 KB onto floppies when
PCs were only getting 720 KB on floppies was to write more data on the
floppy tracks far from the center than on the tracks near the center. 
This was clever, but extremely incompatible. 

<p>
There <em>are</em> ways to squeeze more information onto PC floppy
drives than PCs usually use.  However, these methods
<em>cannot</em> be used to write or even read 800 KB Macintosh formatted floppies. 

<p>
Luckily, very little is supplied on 800 KB floppies anymore, but if
you have some, you're almost definitely going to need the use of a
Macintosh somewhere to copy the contents onto &quot;HD&quot; 1.4 MB
formatted floppies (PCs and Macs use the same low-level format for 1.4 MB
floppies).  
<p>
One Executor Enthusiast suggested using Kinko's public Macs for this
purpose, and this description was given:
<pre>
1.  Moving 800 KB Mac Files onto 1.44 MB Mac disks.  The easiest thing
that I have found when working on a real Mac is to preformat the
Mac disks to 1.44 MB.  Insert the 1.44 MB disk and eject it with
(Cmd-E).  Then insert the 800 KB mac disk.  Drag the icon of the 800
KB disk over the 1.44 MB disk.  All the files will be transferred as
will the file names.  The Mactools fastcopy program can also copy
between densities.

2.  Kinko's Public Machines.  Kinko's public Macs are equipped with a
program known as &quot;Desk Tracy&quot; which is designed to stop people from
pirating Kinko's software from the hard disk.  The problem is that when
you are copying files between your own disks the program will still
trigger if the file has a namesake on the Kinko's machine. What you
will need to do is get a Kinko's employee to shut the program off,
which is obviously a discretionary call with them.  I didn't have a
problem and have done it twice, but we obviously will be using
different Kinko's.

Question 2.4.  Does Executor have networking
support?
</h2></A>

Currently, no.  Some Networking support may be included in Executor 3,
but we do not yet have an estimated date of completion for Executor 3.
 The first platform to have networking support built in will probably
be Linux.  NOTE: networking support will most likely first be an
implementation of Open Transport and/or MacTCP, followed by EtherTalk.
 Supporting AppleTalk over serial lines is unlikely to happen due to
differences in PC and Mac hardware.  
<A name="q_2_5"><h2>
Question 2.5.  How do you install Fonts and Desk Accessories
(DAs)?
</h2></A>

You just drag them into the hot-band and our browser will do the right
thing.  However, we only support bit-mapped fonts, not Type 1 or
TrueType fonts.  In addition, there is a bug which causes the hot-band
to forget which desk accessories have been loaded, which then makes it
impossible to remove desk accessories.  
<A name="q_2_6"><h2>
Question 2.6.  Will Desk Accessories work under
Executor?
</h2></A>

Currently Desk Accessory support is very weak; most will not run. 
When we add support for extensions, we'll also go back and fix some
desk accessory bugs.  
<A name="q_2_7"><h2>
Question 2.7.  Why do some installers not
work?
</h2></A>

Currently there is one major class of application installer that is
known not to work with Executor.  Installers based on Apple's old
Installer do not work.  An example is Microsoft Word 5's installer. 
Some installers require that you use Cmd-shift-5 and set the system
version to 7 and turn on the &quot;Pretend&quot; options before
they'll work properly.  <hr>
