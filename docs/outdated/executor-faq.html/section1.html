Question 1.2.  Does Executor require ROMs or System Files from
Apple?
</h2></A>

No.  Executor re-implements from scratch a subset of the routines that
make up Apple's Macintosh Operating System and Toolbox. 

<A name="q_1_3"><h2>
Question 1.3.  Is Executor shareware?
</h2></A>

NO.  Executor is a commercial program.  
<p>
We do make demo versions which have some significant functionality
removed from them.  The demo versions are the only versions that
should be found on bulletin boards or FTP sites.  If you find a
non-limited version of Executor available to download, it was put
there illegally and it is illegal to use it.
