Question 4.1.  How does Executor/Win32 compare to
Executor/DOS?
</h2></A>

Executor/Win32 is a Win32 application and can run only under Windows
95 or later and Windows NT 4 or later.  For those platforms,
Executor/Win32 is preferred, since it will usually have fewer
compatibility problems and it runs in its own window, or full-screen. 
Some people are still running OS/2, Windows 3.x or even DOS, and they
can't run Executor/Win32.  Additionally, Executor/Win32 can't be run
on a SX-class 386 machine.  Such machines are very old and very slow,
but they can still run Executor/DOS.  
<p>
Our product, Executor for Windows, includes both Executor/Win32 and
Executor/DOS, so you don't have to choose one or the other when
ordering.

Question 4.2.  How do I use command-line switches with
Executor/Win32?
</h2></A>

Command-line switches can be used by creating a
short-cut or by creating the file <code>commands.txt</code>, or a combination of both.  
<p>
To use command-line switches with a short-cut, you need to create a
short-cut to <code>executor.exe</code>, then select it and choose &quot;Properties...&quot;
using your right mouse.  The Properties panel has several tabs, one of
which is labeled &quot;Shortcut&quot;.  After selecting the Shortcut
tab, you can then edit the &quot;Target:&quot; field.  Keep the information that is
already in there (e.g. &quot;<code>C:\ExecWin32\executor.exe</code>&quot;) and then add a space, followed by the command-line option(s) you want to use when you
double-click on that short-cut (e.g. &quot; -size 800x600 -applzone
4m&quot;).  
<p>
Since you can use command-line switches to specify a Macintosh program
for Executor to run, you can create individual short-cuts for
individual programs (e.g. &quot; C:\ExecWin32\Apps\Freeware\Risk!&quot;).  
<p>
If you have some command-line switches that you want to apply to
<em>all</em> invocations of Executor, you can create a file called
<code>commands.txt</code> in the same directory that includes <code>executor.exe</code>.  You can put all the switches on one line, or
use a separate line for each switch.  
<p>
Switches in commands.txt override the ones that are specified in
short-cuts.

Question 4.3.  Why do I get only a black screen when running
Executor/Win32?
</h2></A>

You've encountered a bug.  The bug may be in your video driver or in
the screen-accessing DLLs that Executor uses. 

<p>
To see if it's in your video driver, try adjusting your Display
settings.  In the Control Panel there's a Display icon. 
Double-clicking that should let you select a panel named
&quot;Settings&quot;, which probably has an &quot;Advanced...&quot; button.  If you click
the &quot;Advanced...&quot; button, you should be able to select a panel
named &quot;Performance&quot;.  Try turning the Performance down and see if
that fixes the problem.  You might also want to try downloading a newer driver
from the maker of your video card.  
<p>
To see if it's our screen-accessing DLLs, Try renaming the file
&quot;<code>SDL-dx5.dll</code>&quot; to &quot;<code>SDL-dx5.dll.SAVE</code>&quot;.  That will prevent Executor from seeing that DLL, so Executor will then use a
different DLL (<code>SDL-dib.dll</code>) which will cause it to access the screen in a different way.  If that solves it, then you may have
found a bug in <code>SDL-dx5.dll</code>.  If so, please send e-mail to <A href="mailto:bugs@ardi.com"><code>bugs@ardi.com</code></A> and let us know.  <hr>
