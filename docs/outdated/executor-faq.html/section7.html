Question 7.1.  May I bundle the DEMO version of Executor on a
CD-ROM?
</h2></A>

The short answer is &quot;yes&quot;.  
<p>
You are able to freely copy and distribute demo versions of Executor,
as long as you follow the restrictions set forth in Executor's license
panel.  Please run the demo version of Executor and choose &quot;About
Executor...&quot; to see the restrictions that you must follow. 

<p>
A suggestion: contact us to make sure you have the latest version of
Executor.  We can tell you if a new release is imminent.

Question 7.2.  Who wrote this FAQ?  Who helped?
</h2></A>

This FAQ was written and is maintained by ARDI employees.  After
learning about them via the old Caldera FAQ, we rewrote our existing
FAQ to use the same tools that the Linux FAQ is built with.  Those
tools were written by Ian Jackson <A href="mailto:ijackson@nyx.cs.du.edu"><code>ijackson@nyx.cs.du.edu</code></A>.  
<p>
We've also had contributions from many Executor Enthusiasts worldwide.
 
<p>
Thanks.
