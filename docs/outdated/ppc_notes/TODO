	THINK ABOUT RAMIFICATIONS OF PPC SP and 68k emulator's A7 IDENTITY

	Auto-create glue for everything we have ctopflags for -- this
		will allow us to track calls made by ppc apps (WP goes
		off into never-never land; dim3 hits suspicious loop)

	support lower-case glue -- EnergyScheming

	It also may make sense to figure out what bug is preventing
	browser from opening macos86 after a launch and also look into
	supporting afpd r/w.

	stub out drag manager -- will help dimensions 3.0 and possibly some
	68k apps

	Need glue for "HoldMemory" -- ImageReady 2.0 (in PS55 folder)

	glue for StdCLib

	/macos86 is opened correctly when double-clicked, but becomes /
	after an application has run (this is when using "-afpd" -- it
	may happen elsewhere, too)

	implement

		CountSymbols

		GetIndSymbol

	Support the init routine

	free resources when processes exit

	look at FreeHand 8's installer's modeswitch

	dump interfacelib symbols and look for ones we can provide easily
