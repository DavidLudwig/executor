Fontgrapher 4.1 demo appears to add 350 to the stack in order to get
some memory that it latrer uses with the stmw instruction.  Since the
stack is 4-byte aligned before 350 is added to it, it's no longer
4-byte aligned afterward -- why does this work on a Mac?  Perhaps
older Macs didn't care?  Perhaps this code doesn't get hit.  Perhaps
the Mac cleans up such accesses.  Perhaps the stack is misaligned
going into that code.  My guess is the code doesn't get hit.
