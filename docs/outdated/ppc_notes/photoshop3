	PS3.0 Installer doesn't run off CD-ROM

		wants to eject CD-ROM, then ask for ATM disk, at least
		if ATM is one of the things being installed (doesn't
		eject disk when ATM not installed)

		If I just try to install PS3 itself, the installer
		runs for a little while and then wants to eject my
		disk
