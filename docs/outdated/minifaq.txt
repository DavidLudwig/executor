What is Executor?

Executor is a commercial emulator that allows non-Macintosh hardware
to run many applications originally written on a Macintosh.  Executor
has many limitations, but surprisingly, speed is not one of them.

If your only experience with emulators is Soft-PC or Soft-Windows
making a Mac emulate a PC, please check out a demo of Executor [see
below -- `Where can I pick up the Executor demos?'] to see just how
quickly Executor can do the reverse.

How can I get more information about Executor?

The FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions list) is the basic source for
Executor information.  It's available wherever the Executor demo is,
with the canonical site being ftp.ardi.com/pub/docs.  See below for
the addresses of mirror sites, most of which are much faster than
ARDI.

It's available in HTML at http://www.ardi.com/executor-faq/index.html.
The FAQ is also included in the docs with each demo.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

On which platforms is Executor available?

Executor/DOS (E/D) is an implementation that runs under DOS, Windows
3.x, Windows '95 and OS/2.  Executor/NEXTSTEP (E/NS) is an
implementation that runs under NEXTSTEP, both on original NeXT
hardware and Intel based hardware running NEXTSTEP.  Executor/Linux
(E/L) is an implementation that runs under Linux for the PC.

Where can I pick up the Executor demos?

If you have Web access, go to

http://www.ardi.com/

There are links there which will let you automatically download
whatever version is the latest.  If you only have plain ftp access,
read on.

The canonical place to find Executor demos is ftp.ardi.com.  However,
ftp.ardi.com is currently only connected to the Internet via a 28.8kb
modem, and as such is really only useful to provide data for mirror
sites. When you connect to ftp.ardi.com it will give you a current
list of those mirror sites.

What limitations will Executor 2 have?

Because the OS and Toolbox have been rewritten from scratch, Executor
2 will have many limitations, including no serial port access, no
AppleTalk, minimal sound, minimal System 7 support, no INITs, no CDEVs
and no Internationalization.

Executor can read and write 1.4 MB Mac formatted floppy disks, but due
to limitations in PC hardware, Executor *can't* read or write 800 KB
floppy disks.

Executor can print directly only to a PostScript printer.  Otherwise,
Executor will print to a PostScript file and you can then use an
interpreter such as GhostScript to print to a printer.

We hope to support full sound and serial port access within six months
of releasing Executor 2, but currently all our effort is concentrated
on preparing 2 for release, so that is only speculation.
---------------------------------------------------------------


How much does Executor cost?

The currently shipping version is the Executor 2.0, and it costs US$249.

Shipping is free within the U.S. or to countries participating in the
Global Priority mail system.  International shipping to other
countries (USPS International Express) is US$20.

An Executor/Linux license allows you to use either the X-Windows
version or the SVGAlib version, but you can not use one and let a
friend use the other at the same time.  Eventually we'll merge the two
versions, but this may not happen until after Executor 2 is released.

All 1.x owners, even those who bought Executor 1.0 a year and a half
ago, are entitled to free upgrades through and including 2.0.x, as
long as the upgrades are picked up electronically.  2.0.x releases
will fix bugs in 2.0, but will not add new functionality.  Beyond 2.0,
when new functionality is added, there will be a small upgrade fee if
you want the the newer versions with the new functionality.

All prices are subject to change.
