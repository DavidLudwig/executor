		    COMMON PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Executor won't install

   A. Is there enough disk space free?  Executor needs 10 MB of hard
      drive space for installation.

   B. If the installation seemed to proceed OK but you don't see an
      icon, this is normal.  See os_tips.txt or w3x_tips.txt for
      instructions on how to create an icon for OS/2 or Windows 3.x.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Executor won't start

   A. If you are using OS/2, Windows 3.x, or Windows 95, check out the
      os2_tips.txt, w3x_tips.txt, or w95_tips.txt files for
      configuration advice.

   B. Executor/DOS users -- do you have a DOS mouse driver loaded and
      enabled?  Since Executor/DOS is a DOS-native program, it needs a
      DOS mouse driver.

   C. Are you running under Windows NT?  If so, you need to start from
      a FULL-SCREEN DOS prompt rather than a windowed prompt.  You may
      also need to use the "-vga" switch.  Executor has trouble with
      SuperVGA video modes on some NT machines.

   D. When all else fails, try starting in so-called desperation mode,
      with the following command line:

           executor -desperate

      This combines the effects of a variety of troubleshooting
      switches, to disable (among other things) Executor's usual
      probing of hardware.  It runs Executor in a minimalist mode.  If
      this succeeds, then you can begin eliminating switches one by
      one until you find the problem area.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Registration problems

   A. If the "OK" button doesn't work, it's almost always caused by a
      typo in the serial number or key.  Check your typing, and use
      all lower-case letters.  If you used previous versions of
      Executor, note that you must use the new key which came with
      Executor 2 and not your old key.

   B. Linux and NEXTSTEP users, are you still running as user root?
      You must be superuser (root) to register.

   C. If Executor tells you that it's registering, but then asks you
      to register again when you start it again, it may mean that you
      have somehow installed two different copies of Executor in two
      different locations.  Make sure you have only one copy on your
      hard drive.

   D. Are you trying to run Executor from the CD?  The expanded
      version of Executor is there in case you want to replace
      specific files from it -- YOU CAN NOT RUN Executor DIRECTLY FROM
      THE CD.  You must install Executor on your hard drive in order
      to run it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

IV. Problems reading your Mac floppies or CDs

   A. Are your floppies high-density (1.44 MB) floppies?  PCs cannot
      read Macintosh 400K or 800K floppies.  In fact, PCs cannot read
      high-density floppies if they've been formatted in 800k format,
      so even if your floppy says "HD" on it, if it was created on an
      old Mac (like an SE), it may be in 800K format.  We apologize for
      the inconvenience this creates, but it's a physical problem that
      would take special hardware to resolve.

   B. Did you select Check for Disk from the File menu and scroll
      along the hotband to view all the Volumes icons?

   C. If you were using another disk earlier, did you eject it via the
      File menu before removing it physically?  Macintoshes do all
      their floppy ejection via hardware that's controlled by
      software.  That means that Macintosh programs always know when a
      floppy has been ejected.  As such, Executor requires you to
      explicitly tell it before you remove a floppy from the drive.
      If you just pop a floppy out and put a new one in, Executor will
      get confused and quite possibly crash, or even worse, corrupt
      data on the floppy.

   D. Is your CD a hybrid, with both DOS and Macintosh sections?
      There are different ways that hybrids can be made.  Some hybrids
      won't work with Executor.

   E. If you are running under Windows '95, and Executor is having
      trouble reading your Mac CDs, you will have to tell Windows '95 to
      run MSCDEX (which is what Executor uses to see CDs).  Simply remove
      the

           rem - By Windows 95 Setup

      portion from fthe mscdex line in your C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  You
      will also need to edit your C:\CONFIG.SYS file and make sure the
      CD-ROM driver is also not commented out.  See w95_tips.txt for
      details.

      CD-ROM problems are so common, that the file "CDINFO.TXT" should be
      installed in your Executor directory, and it contains even more
      information about MSCDEX.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

V. Problems using mouse or keyboard

   A. If you are using a non-United States keyboard, type

           executor -keyboards

      (plural) to get a list of keyboard maps Executor can support.
      Start with the line

           executor -keyboard keyboard_map_name

      (with "keyboard" singular) to invoke that keyboard map.

      If this does not work properly, you may need to set your system
      software to American keyboard mode and then try the "-keyboard"
      switch again.

   B. Does your right alt key work as a second command key instead of
      as an option key?  Linux users, check your .Xdefaults file to
      make sure that the right_alt line is not commented out.  It is
      commented out by default in many distributions.
   
   C. Are you running on a laptop with only one alt key?  There is yet
      no easy way to change another key to function as an option key.
      You will have to use the pull-down menus to access these
      functions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
VI. Your Macintosh program won't install

   A. Does the installer fail to work?  The older version of Apple's
      Apple Installer will not run under Executor.  See the
      install.txt file for instructions on installing these programs.

   B. Does the program complain that there is not enough disk space to
      install?  Make a new Macintosh volume with the makehfv program
      (see "Making HFV Files" in the minimanual), and install the
      program there.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
VII. Your Macintosh program won't run

   A. Are you installing a program?  The older version of Apple's
      Apple Installer will not run under Executor.  See the
      install.txt file for instructions on installing these programs.

   A. Does the program need System 7.5 or QuickTime?  Is it an INIT or
      CDEV?  Does it require a modem or a network?  Executor does not
      currently support those Macintosh features, and so such programs
      won't run.

   B. Does it need System 7?  Use the "-system" command line switch to
      start Executor in System 7 mode.  Then save your preferences in
      the Preferences Panel (see "Command Line Switches" and "The
      Preferences Panel" in the minimanual).

   C. Try allocating more memory with the "-memory" switch.
      Insufficient memory can cause a variety of strange errors.

   D. Try setting Executor to "Pretend" sound (see "The Preferences
      Panel" in the minimanual), or turning Executor's and the
      program's sound completely off.  Sound support is new, and some
      programs will work better without it.
