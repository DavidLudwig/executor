		     INSTALLATION UNDER OS/2 WARP


1.) Insert the Executor CD into the CD-ROM drive.

2.) Run the installation program.  You can do this from a DOS prompt
by typing

	D:\install

(assuming that your CD-ROM drive is your D: drive), or you can do it
from the OS/2 desktop:

	Right-click the CD object on the Launch Pad, click the arrow
	next to Open, and choose Icon view.

	A window should pop up showing all the disk's program objects.
	Double-click on INSTALL.EXE to start the installation program.

3.) Change the destination directory for installation if you do not
want to install in C:\EXECUTOR.  Press the number 2 when you are ready
to begin the installation.

4.) When the DOS installation program has finished, double-click
OS/2's Add Programs object in the System Setup folder.  Press the
enter key to have OS/2 detect the new Executor program automatically.
If autodetection fails, click on "Yes" to search for and select the
new program for the desktop.

5.) Select C:\EXECUTOR\EXECUTOR.EXE and click OK.  There will then be
a new folder on your desktop containing the Executor object.



		    CONFIGURATION UNDER OS/2 WARP

The default DOS settings OS/2 assigns for you may work perfectly.  If
Executor behaves strangely, though, then you might want to adjust the
settings by hand.  To do this, right-click on the Executor object and
click Settings.  Then click the notebook's Session tab and click the
DOS settings button.  Click OK, and the list of DOS settings should be
displayed.

Here are some settings other OS/2 users have used with success:

DOS_HIGH			On
DPMI_DOS_API 			ENABLED
DPMI_MEMORY_LIMIT 		16
EMS_MEMORY_LIMIT 		0
HW_ROM_TO_RAM 			On
HW_TIMER 			On
INT_DURING_IO 			On
VIDEO_8514A_XGA_IOTRAP		Off
VIDEO_FASTPASTE			Off
VIDEO_MODE_RESTRICTION		NONE        
VIDEO_ONDEMAND_MEMORY		On
VIDEO_RETRACE_EMULATION		Off
VIDEO_ROM_EMULATION		Off
VIDEO_SWITCH_NOTIFICATION 	Off
VIDEO_WINDOW_REFRESH		1
XMS_HANDLES			0
XMS_MEMORY_LIMIT		0


You don't need to find an "OK" or "Save" button to save these
settings.  The changes take place as soon as you adjust them.

Note that increasing the DPMI memory limit does not automatically
increase the memory Executor uses.  You must also use Executor's
"-memory" command line switch, to tell Executor that more memory is
available.

If after adjusting the settings you still have trouble running
Executor/DOS under OS/2, write to support@ardi.com with your serial
number and your system details.  We'll try to figure out a combination
of settings which will work for you.

Some OS/2 Executor users like to start Executor from a batch file
instead of starting Executor directly, because on some systems it
doesn't show up in the task list unless started indirectly.  If you
want to do this, just make a text file called "executor.bat" which
contains the following two lines:

@echo off
executor.exe %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

Then point your desktop object to this batch file rather than to
executor.exe itself.  If you want to run another program to enhance
Executor, such as UniVBE (a universal video driver which speeds up
graphics performance), you can add its command to the Executor batch
file as well:

@echo off
univbe
executor.exe %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
