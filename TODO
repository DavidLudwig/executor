        Look into fixes for the bad padding we're getting on Mac OS X PPC

                fcbrec definitely kills us, others may too

                further populate check_structs.c

	package up the System Folder and whatnot so that people w/o the
	old executor-aux can run Executor

                do this before or after switching to GNU build system?

        probably get rid of most of the customization stuff (don't yet
        wholesale kill it, since some might be useful as per-user,
        per-app or command line configuration)

                splash screen stuff: does it even make sense anymore,
                since the app should come up quickly now

	Try building the mingw32 version using the mingw32 toolchain
	for Fedora 11 (mingw32 has been done before)

	Probably want to do an in-use / marked for deletion fix

		of what data structure?  I didn't write that down when
		I first put this entry into the TODO file

	Probably should get rid of SDL_bmp.c

		loook at SDL_SaveBMP_RW and SDL_LoadBMP_RW in SDL_video.h
