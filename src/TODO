        GNU build fixes

                stuff is being left behind

                        {src,pat}-blitters.{h,s}
                        asmsamples.h
                        parse.c

                Make it so people can select the front-end and the
                sound, but that we default to SDL if it's available

                Make it so if we don't find libsyn68k, we die properly
                (unless we're on a 68k)

                See if there's a more elegant solution to the blitters
                code (can we nuke the config/arch/i386 prefixes in the
                dependencies? should we make it so both source and pattern
                blitters can be done in parallel?

                test parallel builds

                Add in as much for the targets we don't currently have
                a machine for as possible

                        arch/alpha
                        arch/m68k

	CToPascalCall -- look hard for arguments that sometimes take a pointer
			and sometimes take a long

	look for casts between pointers and longs
