        GNU build fixes

                Make it so people can select the front-end and the
                sound, but that we default to SDL if it's available

                Make it so if we don't find libsyn68k, we die properly
                (unless we're on a 68k)

                See if there's a more elegant way to identify the build
                parameters than our current per-target override using
                -DCOMPILE_FOR_BUILD

                See if there's a more elegant solution to the blitters
                code (can we nuke the config/arch/i386 prefixes in the
                dependencies? should we make it so both source and pattern
                blitters can be done in parallel?

                test parallel builds

	CToPascalCall -- look hard for arguments that sometimes take a pointer
			and sometimes take a long

	look for casts between pointers and longs
