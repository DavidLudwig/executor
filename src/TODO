        GNU build fixes

                can clean up a bunch of repeated partial paths by making
                things like archdir=config/arch/$host_arch

                See if there's a more elegant solution to the blitters
                code (can we nuke the config/arch/i386 prefixes in the
                dependencies? should we make it so both source and pattern
                blitters can be done in parallel?

                test parallel builds

	CToPascalCall -- look hard for arguments that sometimes take a pointer
			and sometimes take a long

	look for casts between pointers and longs
