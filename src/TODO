DONE	look for all occurences of EM_A in ROMlib code

DONE	look for all occurences of destroy_blocks in ROMlib code

DONE	look for all occurences of -1 used as a pointer (like in NewWindow)

DONE	look at all xDEF code since they tend to cast parameters and return
	types:

DONE	look at all the code that calls xDEFs

DONE	look for pointers hidden in event manager routines
		especially message field

DONE	look for all P_ jobbies (convert them to ROMlib addresses and
					deconvert them appropriately)

DONE	all calls to CALL_EMULATOR

	CToPascalCall -- look hard for arguments that sometimes take a pointer
			and sometimes take a long

	look for casts between pointers and longs

KNOWN DIFFERENCES:

DONE	Browser complains about not being able to delete its backup
	state

DONE	Compact Pro dies instantly

DONE	Printing from Compact Pro Users's Guide dies

DONE	Double-clicking on one of the Tex-Edit documents causes a -120
	error instead of opening the document

DONE	Opening a document with File->Open... causes trouble, too

DONE	Claris Works 3.0 dies immediately

DONE	Claris Works dies when trying to create a Word Processing document

DONE	Compact Pro User's guide "About PostCard..." dialog box is off the
	upper left hand of the screen
		MoveWindow has different args

DONE	Cmd-Shift-5 under Browser dies

DONE	Illustrator dies during startup

DONE	Resorcerer Demo dies during startup

DONE	Word has purple buttons

DONE	Marathon demo dies during startup

DONE	FileMaker Pro dies during startup

DONE	Word dies during startup

DONE	Quark dies during startup

DONE	Quark dies while opening file

DONE	Excel dies when you click on "OK" button after asking for help.

DONE	ClarisWorks Tour (Projector dies during startup)

DONE	Risk seems to have problems with Shift keys

DONE	Lemmings Demo has no sound

DONE	Eric's Ultimate wedges at end of game (sound related, likely)

DONE	Rescue died when I turned sound on in the middle of the game
	(may not be offset memory related)

DONE	Sound turns itself off when running Rescue with prefs that say
	we want it.

DONE	Fatty Bear is real slow on buy, but that may be sound related

DONE	Ultima III crashes on startup

DONE	Quicken 4 dies (lat one I've tested today, May 2)

DONE	Haven't tested Object Modeler

DONE	Nisus may die earlier w/memory offset

DONE	Apeiron dies

DONE	Claris Works ruler has messed up numbers on top
	(NOTE: although I just did a bunch of floating point changes, I
	didn't introduce a bug, per-se, becuase the same code works when
	ROMlib_offset is zero)

DONE	About Tex-Edit has black bullets under Executor/DOS -offset
	(but not under /net/buy/usr/local/builds/linux-debug -offset)
	[Time to try /net/buy/usr/local/builds/linux-temp -offset]
