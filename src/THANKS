Executor THANKS file

Executor was originally written by Clifford T. Matthews, with major
contributions from Mat Hostetter, Cotton Seed, Bill Goldman and
Patrick LoPresti.

The MSDOS port included a sound driver from Joel Hunter, DOS Serial port
support from Samuel Vincint and low-level CD-ROM access from Lauri Pesonen.

Sam Lantinga did the initial port to Windows and created an intermediate
library that became SDL.

The windows appearance option uses "Jim's CDEFs" copyright Jim Stout
    and the "Infinity Windoid" copyright Troy Gaul.
