Do not remove floppy disks or CD-ROMs from their drives while Executor
is running unless you have clicked on an "Eject" button and Executor
has told you that it's OK to remove it.  Changing removable media
behind Executor's back will cause Executor to crash, just like pushing
a paper-clip into a Macintosh floppy drive and changing floppies
without the Macintosh knowing will cause a Macintosh to crash.

If a program claims that it needs System 7 to run, use Cmd-Shift-5 to
bring up the preferences panel.  You can then alter which version of
the System Executor emulates.  More details are available on pages 19
and 23 of the Executor 2 manual.

Cmd-Shift-3 causes Executor to create a TIFF screen dump.

If you would like fewer choices in the "Page Setup..." dialog box, you
can edit the file printers.ini to remove entries that correspond to printers
that you don't have.
