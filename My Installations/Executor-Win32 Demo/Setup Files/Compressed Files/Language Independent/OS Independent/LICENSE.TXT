This is a demo version of Executor.  This demo is available solely so you can evaluate whether or not Executor is worth purchasing.  This demo should expire at the end of the 30th day after you have installed it.  In this demo version, all pages printed will have "Demo" written on them.  This demo version of Executor will read Macintosh formatted floppies and hard drives but will not allow you to write to or format them.  The remaining difference between this demo version and the commercial version of Executor is that Command-Key equivalents will not work in this demo version.
